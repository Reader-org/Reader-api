## To contribute in this api please follows these conventions

1. Do not contribute anything directly to master . Fork the development branch of the api and made your chnages there once you have done the changes and tested them then open a pull request for the changes.

2. The master branch is deployed on heroku so your code should not break the api as master branch is always on the edge for production 

3. Please add meaningful name to the variables 

4. The code should be self explanatory

5. The changes you have made should have been tested by you in production environment also.

6. Your changes should not break the code


Thats it folks these are the conventions you  need to follow.

We are always open for changes which make our api better and help the budding programmers out there in their journey for knowledge gain and fun.
